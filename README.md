# Javascript Clocks

Weirdly i'm pretty obsessed with time. The wastage of it. The ability to gain more of it...our lives are pretty much run by it!

It pretty much runs the modern world whether or not you believe time itself actually exists itself (go debate with the physics boys on this!).

I was also inspired by the new nike ads around time and modern day society. I also love mr.robot the show so thought I;d create a quick mega mashup of both these elements.

I thought it would be fun to build some JS timers.  One that allows you to set a countdown timer and one that is simply an output of time.

Most importantly, i did this to get a handle on how to use JS methods to manipulate time and build cool functional clocks/timers etc

These relate back to my first project that I built whilst on a bootcamp course and essentially I built a pretty long winded timer.  Now i have found nicer timers online, I followed some good instructions and will do a few things with these:

 1. I will implement these cleaner timers in the rebuild of my first game
 2. I will add this to my portfolio page to build a timer countdown page

#clock.js

Is built by using JS time functions/ methods available such as getHours/seconds etc It's pretty verbose but you can see how it was built up including how to display it.

#countdownTimer.js

Was built on similar principals as clock.js with the difference being that you set the deadline of when you want your countdown timer to begin.  

I will be adding a cookie implementation that should keep the time no matter if you navigate from pages at a later date.

Follow your dreams whatever they are-

but just remember time waits for no one...
